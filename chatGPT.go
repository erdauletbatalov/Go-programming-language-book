how to get domain array using ip address in go

To get the domain name associated with an IP address in Go, you can use the net.LookupAddr function from the net package. This function takes an IP address as a string and returns a slice of strings containing the domain names associated with that IP address.

Here's an example of how to use net.LookupAddr:

Copy code
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net"
)

func main() {
	// Replace with the IP address you want to look up
	ip := "8.8.8.8"

	// Look up the domain names associated with the IP address
	domains, err := net.LookupAddr(ip)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	// Print the domain names
	fmt.Println(domains)
}
This will print a slice of strings containing the domain names associated with the specified IP address. Note that the slice may be empty if no domain names are found, or if the IP address is not a valid IP address.

how to get DNS PTR query using ip address
To get the PTR (Pointer) record for an IP address in Go, you can use the net.LookupAddr function from the net package. This function takes an IP address as a string and returns a slice of strings containing the PTR records associated with that IP address.

Here's an example of how to use net.LookupAddr to get the PTR record for an IP address:

Copy code
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net"
)

func main() {
	// Replace with the IP address you want to look up
	ip := "8.8.8.8"

	// Look up the PTR records associated with the IP address
	ptrs, err := net.LookupAddr(ip)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	// Print the PTR records
	fmt.Println(ptrs)
}
This will print a slice of strings containing the PTR records associated with the specified IP address. Note that the slice may be empty if no PTR records are found, or if the IP address is not a valid IP address.

Alternatively, you can use the net.LookupIP function to perform a DNS PTR query and get the IP addresses associated with a domain name. This function takes a domain name as a string and returns a slice of net.IP values containing the IP addresses associated with that domain name.

Here's an example of how to use net.LookupIP to perform a DNS PTR query:

Copy code
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net"
)

func main() {
	// Replace with the domain name you want to look up
	domain := "google.com"

	// Perform the DNS PTR query
	ips, err := net.LookupIP(domain)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	// Print the IP addresses
	for _, ip := range ips {
		fmt.Println(ip)
	}
}
This will print the IP addresses associated with the specified domain name. Note that the slice may be empty if no IP addresses are found, or if the domain name is not a valid domain name.

how to get DNS PTR query's TTL using ip address
To get the Time To Live (TTL) of a DNS PTR record in Go, you can use the net.LookupTXT function from the net package. This function takes a domain name as a string and returns a slice of strings containing the text records associated with that domain name.

To get the TTL of a PTR record, you can use the net.LookupTXT function to perform a DNS TXT query for the PTR record's domain name, and then parse the returned text records to extract the TTL value.

Here's an example of how to use net.LookupTXT to get the TTL of a DNS PTR record:

Copy code
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net"
	"strconv"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	// Replace with the IP address you want to look up
	ip := "8.8.8.8"

	// Look up the PTR records associated with the IP address
	ptrs, err := net.LookupAddr(ip)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	// Iterate through the PTR records
	for _, ptr := range ptrs {
		// Perform a DNS TXT query for the PTR record's domain name
		txts, err := net.LookupTXT(ptr)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println(err)
			continue
		}

		// Iterate through the returned text records
		for _, txt := range txts {
			// Split the text record into fields
			fields := strings.Split(txt, " ")

			// Check if the first field is "TTL"
			if fields[0] == "TTL" {
				// The second field is the TTL value
				ttl, err := strconv.Atoi(fields[1])
				if err != nil {
					fmt.Println(err)
					continue
				}

				// Print the TTL value
				fmt.Println(ttl)
				break
			}
		}
	}
}
This will print the TTL value of the first PTR record that has a TTL field in its text records. Note that the TTL value is returned as an integer, and that the TTL value may not be present in all PTR records.












// is there a better way in terms of perfomance
// The method I provided uses the net.LookupAddr and net.LookupTXT functions to get the PTR record and its associated text records, respectively. These functions make DNS queries to look up the PTR record and its text records, which can be time-consuming and may not be the most efficient way to get the TTL value of a PTR record.

// An alternative approach to get the TTL value of a PTR record would be to use a lower-level DNS library that allows you to directly query the DNS server and get the raw DNS response. This would allow you to parse the DNS response and extract the TTL value without having to make multiple DNS queries.

// One such library is "miekg/dns", which is a popular DNS library for Go. With this library, you can use the dns.Client.Exchange function to send a DNS PTR query and get the raw DNS response. You can then parse the DNS response to extract the TTL value of the PTR record.

// Here's an example of how to use the "miekg/dns" library to get the TTL value of a DNS PTR record:

// Copy code
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/miekg/dns"
)

func main() {
	// Replace with the IP address you want to look up
	ip := "8.8.8.8"

	// Create a DNS client
	client := dns.Client{}

	// Build the DNS PTR query message
	msg := dns.Msg{}
	msg.SetQuestion(dns.Fqdn(ip+".in-addr.arpa."), dns.TypePTR)

	// Send the DNS PTR query and get the response
	r, _, err := client.Exchange(&msg, "8.8.8.8:53")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}

	// Get the first PTR record from the response
	if len(r.Answer) < 1 {
		fmt.Println("No PTR records found")
		return
	}
	ptrRecord := r.Answer[0]

	// Check if the record is a PTR record
	if ptrRecord.Header().Rrtype != dns.TypePTR {
		fmt.Println("Record is not a PTR record")
		return
	}

	// Cast the record to a PTR record
	ptr, ok := ptrRecord.(*dns.PTR)
	if !ok {
		fmt.Println("Error casting record to PTR")
		return
	}

	// Print the TTL value of the PTR record
	fmt.Println(ptr.Hdr.Ttl)
}

// This will print the TTL value of the PTR record returned by the DNS server. Using a lower-level DNS library like "miekg/dns" may be more efficient than using the net package's higher-level functions, as it allows you to directly query the DNS server and avoid making multiple DNS queries. However, it may require more code and be more complex to use.
