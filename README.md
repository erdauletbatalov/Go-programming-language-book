# Playground

Welcome to the **Playground** repository! This repository is designed for educational purposes, providing a space to experiment with various topics and concepts in programming and Git.

## Overview

In this repository, each branch corresponds to a specific topic or learning exercise. The `master` branch is not utilized, allowing for a clean structure focused on topic-based branches. 

## Creating Branches

To create a new branch without any previous commit history, you can use the following command:

```bash
git switch --orphan <branch>
```

Replace <branch> with the name of your new branch. This command creates a new branch that starts with no commit history, making it ideal for educational experiments.

## Branch Structure

*	Each branch represents a different topic or area of study.
*	Feel free to explore, modify, and learn through practical examples.

## Contributing

This repository is meant for personal educational use. If you want to contribute or share your own experiments, feel free to fork the repository and create your branches using the method described above.
